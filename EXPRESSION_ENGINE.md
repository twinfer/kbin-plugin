# Expression Engine Implementation Summary

A comprehensive expression engine for our Kaitai Struct Benthos plugin that can handle Kaitai's expression language. Here's a summary of the key components:

## 1. Core Expression Engine (`internal/expression/`)

### arithmetic.go
- Implemented arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, %, **)
- Added comparison operations (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=)
- Supported logical operations (&&, ||, !)
- Implemented type conversion utilities for numeric operations

### bitwise.go
- Added support for bitwise operations (&, |, ^, ~, <<, >>)
- Implemented bit manipulation functions
- Handled proper integer conversions for bitwise operations

### functions.go
- Implemented Kaitai-specific functions:
  - String operations: `to_s()`, `reverse()`, `length`
  - Type conversions: `to_i()`, `to_f()`
  - Array operations: `at()`, `size()`, `count()`
  - Math operations: `abs()`, `min()`, `max()`, `ceil()`, `floor()`, `round()`
  - Special operations: `ternary()`
  - Processing functions: `processXor()`, `processZlib()`, `processRotate()`

## 2. Integration with Kaitai Interpreter (`pkg/kaitaistruct/`)

### expression.go
- Created `ExpressionPool` for caching compiled expressions
- Built expression transformation engine to convert Kaitai syntax to Govaluate syntax
- Integrated our custom functions with Govaluate
- Added helper methods for type conversions and boolean operations

## Key Features

1. **Expression Transformation**:
   - Converts Kaitai syntax like `value & 0x80 != 0` to Govaluate syntax like `bitAnd(value, 0x80) != 0`
   - Transforms method calls like `array.length` to function calls like `length(array)`
   - Handles ternary operator: `condition ? value1 : value2` â†’ `ternary(condition, value1, value2)`

2. **Context Handling**:
   - Properly manages context for parent/root references
   - Provides access to IO for stream operations
   - Maintains proper scoping for nested types

3. **Type Management**:
   - Robust type conversions between different numeric types
   - Proper handling of strings, arrays, and custom types
   - Boolean conversion rules matching Kaitai's semantics

4. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Expression caching to avoid recompilation
   - Efficient type handling to minimize conversions
   - Proper memory management for large binary data

## Test Coverage

We've created comprehensive tests for:
- Arithmetic operations
- Bitwise operations
- Kaitai-specific functions
- Expression transformations
- Type conversions
- Integration with the Kaitai interpreter

This expression engine implementation provides the foundation for dynamically interpreting Kaitai Struct schemas without requiring code generation. It enables  Benthos plugin to flexibly handle binary formats with all the power of Kaitai's expression language.
