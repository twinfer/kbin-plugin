1. Core Transformation and Evaluation (ASTTransformer.go, pool.go)
ASTTransformer.go:

Strength: Using the Visitor pattern to traverse your custom Kaitai expression AST (pkg/expression/expression_ast.go) and convert it to a CEL string is a robust and maintainable approach. This is far superior to regex-based transformations for complex grammars.
Transformation Logic:
The mappings for literals, identifiers, special Kaitai variables (_io, _parent, etc.), unary operators, and binary operators (including bitwise ops to custom CEL functions and standard ops to CEL equivalents) look solid.
Attribute access (obj.field) and special _io attribute-like function calls (_io.pos -> pos(_io)) are handled well.
Array indexing (arr[idx]) correctly maps to your custom at(arr, idx) CEL function.
Function calls (func(args), obj.method(args), _io.method(args)) are transformed by looking up mappings in mapKaitaiFunctionToCEL and mapKaitaiIoMethodToCEL. This is a flexible design.
Ternary operator (cond ? true_val : false_val) correctly maps to your custom ternary(...) CEL function.
Type casts (value.as<type>()) map to custom conversion functions (to_i, to_f) via mapKaitaiTypeToCELConversion.
Helper Maps: The mapKaitaiTypeToCELConversion, mapKaitaiFunctionToCEL, and mapKaitaiIoMethodToCEL are critical.
Suggestion: Double-check these maps for completeness against the full set of Kaitai Struct built-in functions, operators, and type system features you intend to support. Ensure consistency in naming between these maps and your actual CEL function definitions (e.g., bytes2str in map vs. bytesToStr in kaitaiAPI.go - though strings.ToLower in the map lookup handles this, exact matches are clearer).
Clarity: The code is well-organized by visitor methods.
ASTTransformer_test.go:

Coverage: The test suite is quite comprehensive, covering a wide range of expression types: literals, identifiers, operators (unary, binary with precedence), ternary, attribute access, array indexing, function calls, and type casts. It also includes tests for unsupported operations and complex combined expressions. This is excellent.
pool.go (ExpressionPool):

Caching: The use of sync.RWMutex for caching compiled cel.Program instances is good for performance.
GetExpression Workflow:
Kaitai Expression String -> Kaitai AST (expression.Parser)
Kaitai AST -> CEL String (ASTTransformer)
CEL String -> Compiled cel.Program This is the correct pipeline.
extractVariables(transformedCelString):
This function's role is to identify potential variable names in the CEL string so they can be declared in the CEL environment (typically as cel.DynType).
The current implementation is a simple regex-free tokenizer that skips known keywords and numbers.
Strength: It's a pragmatic approach for dynamic environments.
Potential Weakness: Simple tokenization might be fragile for very complex CEL expressions or unusual variable names that might collide with its keyword list or resemble numbers. However, for most Kaitai expressions, it's likely sufficient.
Alternative (More Complex): A more robust (but significantly more complex) way to get undeclared variables would be to use CEL's parsing capabilities to analyze the expression for undeclared references before full compilation. However, the current approach is a common and practical solution.
EvaluateExpression:
Correctly creates a CEL activation from the provided params.
Uses program.Eval(activation) for evaluation.
adaptCELResult(val any):
This function converts CEL result types back to Go native types.
Current Behavior: It converts all CEL numeric types (types.Int, types.Uint, types.Double) to float64.
Suggestion: Consider preserving integer types where possible. For example, types.Int could map to int64 and types.Uint to uint64. This provides more type fidelity. If downstream code consuming these results uniformly expects float64, the current approach is fine, but it's a point of potential precision loss or type ambiguity.
Handling of types.Bool, types.String, types.Bytes, types.Null, lists, and maps (with recursive adaptation) is good.

2. CEL Environment and Custom Functions (environment.go, *Functions.go)
environment.go (NewEnvironment):

Correctly initializes the CEL environment with cel.StdLib() and cel.CustomTypeAdapter(types.DefaultTypeAdapter).
Registers all the custom function libraries.
Minor: errorHandlingFunctions() is listed twice. This is harmless but can be cleaned up.
The commented-out processFunctions() and sizeFunctions() are correctly noted as their functionalities have been merged elsewhere or handled differently.
Custom Function Libraries:

General: Most libraries correctly define functions, overloads, and use cel.UnaryBinding or cel.BinaryBinding with Go functions that return ref.Val. Error handling using types.NewErr is appropriate.
arrayFunctions.go (at): Good overloads for lists and strings, with bounds checking.
bitwiseFunctions.go: Correct implementations for standard bitwise operations on integers. Shift functions correctly check for negative shift amounts.
kaitaiAPI.go:
Wraps kaitai_struct_go_runtime functions well.
bytesToStr: The explicit use of unicode.UTF8.NewDecoder() for the default overload and specific decoders for other encodings (UTF-16LE/BE) in the two-argument overload is robust and a good improvement over relying on kaitai.BytesToStr with a nil decoder. The dst buffer allocation (len(src)*3) is safe.
processXOR: Good set of overloads for different key types (bytes, int, uint).
mathFunctions.go:
Provides standard math functions.
Suggestion: For ceil, floor, and round, consider using Go's standard library math.Ceil, math.Floor, math.Round directly within the CEL bindings. While the current implementations are functional, using the stdlib functions can be clearer and might handle edge cases (like NaN, Inf) more comprehensively if those are relevant for your CEL expressions.
safeArithmeticFunctions.go (mul, add, ternary):
The ASTTransformer maps standard arithmetic operators like + and * to CEL's native operators, not these custom add() and mul() functions. If these custom functions are intended as replacements that the transformer should use (e.g., for overflow checking, though not implemented here), the transformer would need to be updated. If they are for other purposes (e.g., direct use in pre-transformed CEL), they are fine. Otherwise, they might be redundant if standard CEL operators suffice.
ternary function is correctly implemented.
streamOperations.go: Comprehensive set of functions for interacting with *kaitai.Stream (_io). The unified read(stream, type_string) is a nice utility.
stringFunctions.go:
to_s: Generic fmt.Sprintf("%v") is a reasonable default.
reverse: Uses kaitai.StringReverse.
length: Good overloads for string (rune count), bytes, list, and map.
typeConversionFunctions.go (to_i, to_f):
to_i: Handles string, uint, double. strconv.ParseInt for string is appropriate.
to_f: Uses val.ConvertToType(cel.DoubleType), which is a good way to leverage CEL's internal conversion capabilities.
writerOperations.go & encodingFunctions.go (within writerOperations.go):
Provides a good set of functions for CEL-driven serialization logic, mirroring many of the stream reading operations.
encodeString and decodeString correctly use golang.org/x/text/encoding.
newWriter and writerBuffer are useful utilities.

3. Deprecated/Old Files
transform.go (regex-based): This is superseded by ASTTransformer.go.
cel_test.go (old tests): Superseded by ASTTransformer_test.go.
size.go (commented out): Functionality merged into stringFunctions.go and streamOperations.go.
processFunctions.go (commented out): Functionality merged into kaitaiAPI.go.
Recommendation: Remove these deprecated files (transform.go, cel_test.go, size.go, processFunctions.go) from the project to improve clarity and reduce maintenance overhead.
Overall Recommendations:
Clean Up Deprecated Files: Remove the identified deprecated files.
adaptCELResult in pool.go: Re-evaluate the decision to convert all numbers to float64. Preserving int64/uint64 might be beneficial for type precision unless float64 is a hard requirement downstream.
safeArithmeticFunctions.go: Clarify the role of custom add and mul functions. If they are not used by the ASTTransformer for standard +/* operations, ensure they have a distinct purpose or consider if they are needed.
mathFunctions.go: Consider using Go's math.Ceil/Floor/Round in the CEL bindings for ceil/floor/round.
ASTTransformer Helper Maps: Perform a thorough audit of mapKaitaiTypeToCELConversion, mapKaitaiFunctionToCEL, and mapKaitaiIoMethodToCEL against the Kaitai Struct specification and your defined CEL functions to ensure comprehensive coverage and exact name matching.
environment.go: Remove the duplicate errorHandlingFunctions() registration.

1. AST Node Coverage:

Your pkg/expression/expression_ast.go defines the following AST node types, which align well with the core expression nodes in the Kaitai Struct AST:

Literals: BoolLit, IntLit, StrLit, FltLit, NullLit (Corresponds to Literal subtypes) - Covered
Identifiers/Variables: Id, Self, Io, Parent, Root, BytesRemaining (Corresponds to Identifier, Self, Io, Parent, Root, Bytes_remaining) - Covered
Operations: UnOp, BinOp, TernaryOp (Corresponds to Unary_op, Binary_op, Ternary_op) - Covered
Member Access/Calls/Indexing: Attr, Call, ArrayIdx (Corresponds to Attribute, Call, Method_call, Array_index) - Covered
Type Conversions/Built-ins: CastToType, SizeOf, AlignOf (Corresponds to Cast_to_type, Size_of, Align_of) - Covered
The AST definition in expression_ast.go seems comprehensive for representing the structure of Kaitai expressions.

2. Transformation Logic (ASTTransformer.go)

The ASTTransformer uses the Visitor pattern (Accept method) to traverse the AST, which is a standard and good practice for AST manipulation.

Literals (VisitBoolLit, VisitIntLit, VisitStrLit, VisitFltLit, VisitNullLit):

Correctly converts Go primitive types to their string representations suitable for CEL literals.
VisitStrLit uses strconv.Quote, which is correct for escaping string literals in CEL.
Covered and Correct.
Identifiers/Special Variables (VisitId, VisitSelf, VisitIo, VisitParent, VisitRoot, VisitBytesRemaining):

Correctly writes the identifier name or the special variable name (_, _io, _parent, _root, _bytes_remaining) directly to the string builder.
Covered and Correct.
Unary Operations (VisitUnOp):

Handles !, -, ~.
Maps ~ (bitwise NOT) to the CEL function bitNot.
Covered and Correct.
Binary Operations (VisitBinOp):

Handles arithmetic (+, -, *, /, %), comparison (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=), logical (&&, ||), and bitwise (&, |, ^, <<, >>).
Maps bitwise operations to custom CEL functions (bitAnd, bitOr, bitXor, bitShiftLeft, bitShiftRight).
Wraps standard infix operations in parentheses (...) for safety, although CEL has its own operator precedence rules. This is a reasonable defensive measure.
Covered and Correct.
Ternary Operation (VisitTernaryOp):

Maps the Kaitai ternary operator (cond ? true_val : false_val) to a CEL function call ternary(cond, true_val, false_val).
Covered and Correct.
Attribute Access (VisitAttr):

Handles generic attribute access receiver.name by recursively visiting the receiver and writing .name.
Special Handling for _io Attributes: Correctly identifies _io.pos, _io.size, _io.eof and maps them to CEL function calls pos(_io), stream_size(_io), isEOF(_io). This is necessary because these are often functions in CEL, not just simple attribute lookups.
Special Handling for size/length Attributes: Correctly identifies obj.size and obj.length and maps them to CEL function calls size(obj) and length(obj). This is also necessary as these are often functions in CEL.
Covered and Correct.
Call (VisitCall):

Handles both global function calls (func(args)) and method calls (obj.method(args)).
Method Calls (obj.method(args)):
Identifies if the receiver is _io. If so, it uses mapKaitaiIoMethodToCEL to find the CEL function name and transforms it to mapped_name(_io, args...). Correct.
If the receiver is not _io, it uses mapKaitaiFunctionToCEL to find the CEL function name and transforms it to mapped_name(receiver, args...). This is the standard transformation for methods on built-in types (string, bytes, list, map) in Kaitai that become global functions in CEL. Correct.
Global Function Calls (func(args)): Uses mapKaitaiFunctionToCEL to find the CEL function name and transforms it to mapped_name(args...). Correct.
Covered and Correct.
Array Index (VisitArrayIdx):

Maps Kaitai array indexing array[index] to the CEL function call at(array, index).
Covered and Correct.
Type Cast (VisitCastToType):

Maps Kaitai type casts .as<type>() to CEL conversion function calls (to_i, to_f) using mapKaitaiTypeToCELConversion.
Covered and Correct.
SizeOf (VisitSizeOf) / AlignOf (VisitAlignOf):

Explicitly returns an error indicating that these are not directly supported in CEL transformation. This is a correct approach for handling unsupported features.
Covered (by reporting as unsupported).
3. Helper Maps (mapKaitaiTypeToCELConversion, mapKaitaiFunctionToCEL, mapKaitaiIoMethodToCEL)

These maps are essential for mapping Kaitai names to CEL names.
mapKaitaiTypeToCELConversion: Covers common integer and float types. Seems sufficient for basic casts.
mapKaitaiFunctionToCEL: Contains mappings for global functions and methods on standard types that are transformed into global functions in CEL. This map seems correctly populated based on the transformation logic in VisitCall.
mapKaitaiIoMethodToCEL: Contains mappings for methods specifically called on the _io object. This map seems correctly populated based on the transformation logic in VisitCall.
4. Deprecated Files

transformer_test.go and transform.go are remnants of a previous regex-based transformation approach. They are not used by the current AST-based system.
Suggestion: These files should be removed to avoid confusion and keep the codebase clean.
Overall Assessment of ASTTransformer.go:

The ASTTransformer is a well-designed and correctly implemented component. It effectively translates the Kaitai expression AST into valid CEL syntax by handling various node types, operators, special variables, member access patterns, function/method calls, and type casts. The use of helper maps makes the mappings configurable. The special handling for _io attributes and size/length attributes is correctly implemented.

The test suite ASTTransformer_test.go provides excellent coverage and validates the transformation logic thoroughly.
